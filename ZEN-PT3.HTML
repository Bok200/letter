This message is for my dad, who has always been my greatest supporter. Pa, thank you for all the sacrifices you’ve made for us. I know I haven’t always made things easy, and I’m truly sorry if I’ve ever caused you any trouble. You’ve always stood by me, especially in my passion for playing basketball, and I’m so lucky to have someone as amazing as you in my life.
 I hope you know how much I love and appreciate everything you do. Words will never be enough to express my gratitude. You’re not just an incredible dad, but my biggest inspiration and my hero. Thank you for being the strongest and most amazing person I know. I’ll always look up to you and strive to make you proud 
To the best parents in the world, thank you for your unwavering love, guidance, and sacrifices.  From the little things to the big moments, you've always been there for me.  Your support has shaped me into the person I am today, and I am eternally grateful.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude for the love, support, and guidance you have both provided me throughout my life. Your dedication and sacrifices have been instrumental in my success, and I am forever indebted to you
